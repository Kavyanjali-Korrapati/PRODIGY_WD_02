# My Stopwatch Web Application
#####  Internship Project – Prodigy InfoTech #######

This project was developed as part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
The objective of this task was to build a fully functional and interactive stopwatch web application using core front-end technologies.

The application allows users to accurately measure time intervals, pause execution, reset the timer, and record lap times in a clean and user-friendly interface.

 #### Technologies Used ####

HTML5 – For structuring the application layout

CSS3 – For styling, layout design, responsiveness, and UI enhancement

JavaScript (ES6) – For implementing stopwatch logic and interactivity
